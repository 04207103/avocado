About Avocado
=============

Avocado is a set of tools and libraries (what people call these days a framework)
to perform automated testing.

Avocado is composed by:

* Programs that let you run tests. Those tests can be either written on your language of choice, or use the python API available. In both cases, you get facilities such as automated log and system information collection.

* APIs that help you write tests in a concise, yet expressive way.
